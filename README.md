## Installation
1. Copy the plugin folder to `wp-content/plugins`.
2. Go to your WordPress admin, Plugins page, and activate "Pricing Table Block".
3. If using a child theme, make sure itâ€™s active in Appearance > Themes.

## Usage
1. In the WordPress editor (Gutenberg), add a "Pricing Table" block.
2. Add tiers (like Basic, Pro, etc.) and fill in prices and features.
3. Edit or remove tiers as you want. Save and preview on your site.

## Assumptions
- Block starts with 2 tiers by default, but you can add more.
- Layout is simple: tiers stack on mobile, side-by-side on desktop.
- No fancy design yet, just basic colors and spacing.

## Considerations
- Accessibility: We tried to use good HTML, but more testing needed.
- Code is split for editor and frontend styles, easy to change.
- You can add more features or change layout in the code if you want.
- "Featured" tier is planned, but not working yet.
